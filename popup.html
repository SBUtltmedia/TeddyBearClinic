 <div id="bubbleContent">Uh oh! Sunny Bear wanted to wear the seatbelt by itself.  But Sunny Bear  is not tall enough yet.  When we are not tall enough for the seatbelt, the shoulder belt can touch our neck like it is on Sunny Bear.  This is not safe. Most kids are not ready to ride in the seatbelt alone until they are at least 4 feet 9 inches tall. </div>
