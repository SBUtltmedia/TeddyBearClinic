say "Uh oh! Sunny Bear wanted to wear the seatbelt by itself.  But Sunny Bear  is not tall enough yet.  When we are not tall enough for the seatbelt, the shoulder belt can touch our neck like it is on Sunny Bear.  This is not safe." -o Parking_Lot_2_2_Sunny_0.aiff
say "We want the shoulder belt to lay across our shoulder and the lap belt to lay low across our hips.  Our shoulders and hips have strong bones that help keep us safe in case there is a car crash. The booster seat helps raise us up to make sure the seatbelts all fit the right way to keep us safe.  Most kids are not ready to ride in the seatbelt alone until they are at least 4 feet 9 inches tall." -o Parking_Lot_2_2_Sunny_1.aiff
